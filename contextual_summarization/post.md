# Handling Long Context RAG for LLMs with Contextual Summarization

---

Responding to user queries when they require analyzing large contexts or many documents can be challenging. A common approach is to slice the documents into smaller chunks and use a search algorithm to retrieve relevant chunks when answering the user query. However using chunks may leave out relevant context, and it is not always clear which chunks to retrieve based on the user's query. Alternatively whole documents or many chunks can be added to the prompt, but LLMs have token limits, making it difficult or impossible to process long contexts in a single prompt. Additionally the LLM may ignore important context when the prompt becomes long. 

So what can we do to improve our ability to handle user queries that involve large amounts of context? One solution is to use contextual summarization. With contextual summarization we use an LLM to summarize or extract relevant information from the documents, and then use the summaries as context when answering the user query. Importantly the summarization LLM is also given the user query which ensures it produces summaries that with relevant information. This is why the technique is called contextual summarization vs just creating a regular summary.

In this blog post I show how contextual summarization can enhance query answering performance when dealing with long contexts or extensive document collections. As an example I implement contextual summarization in python using OpenAI and use it to answer queries on one of Alphabet's earnings reports.

#### Code Example

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ['OPENAI_KEY'])

system_prompt = """
You are a summarization AI.
You will be given a user query and a sequence of text chunks.
Your task is to extract relevant information and summarize each text chunk contextually based on the user query.
The extracted information and summaries will be used by a downstream LLM to answer the user query, so it is important you extract relevant information.

For your output only output a string with the relevant information/summary. Do not output anything else.
"""

instruction_template = """
The user query is:
{query}

The log of previous summaries is:
{summaries}

Now extract information from and summarize passage {page_number}/{total}:
{passage}
"""

# Read the full text of Shakespeare's works
full_text = open("./data/google.txt").read()

# Define the chunk size and split the text
chunk_size = 2000  # Adjusted for demonstration purposes
chunks = [full_text[i:i+chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(full_text), chunk_size)]

query = "How did the performance compare to last quarter?"

summaries = []

def call_llm(system_prompt, instruction):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",  # Use "gpt-4" if you have access
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": instruction}
        ],
        max_tokens=2000,  # Adjust as needed
        temperature=0.2,
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    print(i,len(chunks))
    summary_string = "\n".join(summaries)
    instruction = instruction_template.format(
        query=query,
        summaries=summary_string,
        page_number=(i + 1),
        total=len(chunks),
        passage=chunk
    )
    # Call the LLM to get the summary
    summary = call_llm(system_prompt, instruction)
    summaries.append(summary)
    print(f"Processed chunk {i + 1}/{len(chunks)}")

# Combine all summaries
final_summary = "\n".join(summaries)

f = open("summary.txt",'w')
f.write(final_summary)
f.close()

# Now, use the final summary to answer the user's query
answer_prompt = f"""
Based on the following summaries, answer the user's query in detail:

User Query:
{query}

Summaries:
{final_summary}
"""

# Get the final answer from the LLM
final_answer = call_llm(system_prompt="", instruction=answer_prompt)
print("Final Answer:")
print(final_answer)

f = open("answer.txt",'w')
f.write(final_answer)
f.close()
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

Let's break down the code step by step to understand how contextual summarization is implemented:

1. **Environment Setup**: The script starts by importing required modules and setting up an API client for OpenAI:
    ```python
    import os
    from openai import OpenAI
    client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ['OPENAI_KEY'])
    ```
    Here, the OpenAI API key is fetched from the environment, allowing secure access to the LLM services.

2. **System Prompt Definition**: The `system_prompt` is defined to instruct the LLM on its role:
    ```python
    system_prompt = """
    You are a summarization AI.
    You will be given a user query and a sequence of text chunks.
    Your task is to extract relevant information and summarize each text chunk contextually based on the user query.
    The extracted information and summaries will be used by a downstream LLM to answer the user query, so it is important you extract relevant information.

    For your output only output a string with the relevant information/summary. Do not output anything else.
    """
    ```
    This prompt ensures the LLM understands the specific taskâ€”extracting information contextually from each passage based on the user query.

3. **Instruction Template**: The instruction template defines the instructions given to the LLM for each chunk of text:
    ```python
    instruction_template = """
    The user query is:
    {query}

    The log of previous summaries is:
    {summaries}

    Now extract information from and summarize passage {page_number}/{total}:
    {passage}
    """
    ```
    By including a log of previous summaries, the LLM can maintain continuity when summarizing multiple chunks.

4. **Splitting the Text into Chunks**: The document is split into chunks, each containing approximately `2000` characters:
    ```python
    full_text = open("./data/google.txt").read()
    chunk_size = 2000
    chunks = [full_text[i:i+chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(full_text), chunk_size)]
    ```
    This approach helps overcome token limitations, as the entire document cannot be processed in a single request.

5. **Looping through Chunks and Summarizing**: The code processes each chunk one at a time, contextualizing the summarization:
    ```python
    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        summary_string = "\n".join(summaries)
        instruction = instruction_template.format(
            query=query,
            summaries=summary_string,
            page_number=(i + 1),
            total=len(chunks),
            passage=chunk
        )
        summary = call_llm(system_prompt, instruction)
        summaries.append(summary)
        print(f"Processed chunk {i + 1}/{len(chunks)}")
    ```
    Each chunk is processed in relation to the user query and prior summaries, allowing the LLM to keep track of important context.

6. **Final Summarization and Query Answering**: After summarizing all chunks, the summaries are combined to create a final summary:
    ```python
    final_summary = "\n".join(summaries)
    answer_prompt = f"""
    Based on the following summaries, answer the user's query in detail:
    User Query:
    {query}
    Summaries:
    {final_summary}
    """
    ```
    The final answer is then generated using the complete summary to address the user's query.

### Testing Contextual Summarization on Earnings Report
To test the code I downloaded Alphabest's Q3 2024 earnings report.
If we now run the code with different queries, we will see that we get detailed answers of our queries about the earnings report (for the generated summaries see the appendix).

For example, using the query `How did the performance compare to last quarter?`, the answer we get is:

```markdown
In comparing Alphabet's performance in the third quarter of 2024 to the previous quarter (second quarter of 2024), several key financial metrics indicate positive growth and improvements:

1. **Revenue Growth**: Alphabet's total constant currency revenues increased by $3.5 billion from the previous quarter, rising from $84.6 billion in Q2 2024 to $88.1 billion in Q3 2024. This represents a 4% increase quarter-over-quarter. Including hedging effects, total revenues were $88.3 billion in Q3 2024.

2. **Geographical Revenue Growth**: The revenue growth was geographically diverse, with the United States and APAC regions each experiencing a 5% increase, EMEA seeing a 2% increase, and Other Americas showing a 7% increase from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024.

3. **Operating Income and Margin**: Operating income rose from $21.3 billion in Q3 2023 to $28.5 billion in Q3 2024, with the operating margin expanding from 28% to 32%. Although specific quarter-over-quarter figures for operating income are not provided, the year-over-year increase suggests continued momentum.

4. **Net Income and Earnings Per Share**: Net income increased significantly to $26.3 billion in Q3 2024 from $19.7 billion in Q3 2023. Diluted earnings per share grew to $2.12 from $1.55 year-over-year, indicating strong profitability. The quarter-over-quarter comparison is not explicitly detailed, but the year-over-year growth reflects a positive trend.

5. **Segment Performance**: Both Google Services and Google Cloud showed substantial growth. Google Services' operating income increased from $23.9 billion to $30.9 billion year-over-year, while Google Cloud's operating income rose from $266 million to $1.9 billion. These segments likely contributed to the quarter-over-quarter revenue increase.

6. **Non-GAAP Measures**: Alphabet's non-GAAP free cash flow for Q3 2024 was $17.637 billion, calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities. This reflects strong cash generation capabilities, although specific quarter-over-quarter changes are not detailed.

7. **Investment and Financial Activities**: Alphabet experienced a $1.8 billion gain on equity securities, which positively impacted net income and diluted EPS. This gain, along with a reversal of performance fees, increased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted EPS by $389 million, $1.5 billion, and $0.12, respectively.

Overall, Alphabet's performance in Q3 2024 showed robust growth compared to the previous quarter, driven by increased revenues across regions, improved operating income and margins, and strong contributions from key business segments like Google Services and Google Cloud. The company's strategic focus on AI innovations and efficiency improvements appears to be yielding positive results.
```

But if we use a query like `What is the current main driver of growth?`, we get the following answer:
```markdown
The main driver of growth for Alphabet in Q3 2024 was the substantial increase in revenues, particularly from two key segments: Google Cloud and Google Services. Here's a detailed breakdown of these growth drivers:

1. **Google Cloud**: 
   - Google Cloud experienced a remarkable 35% increase in revenue, rising from $8,411 million to $11,353 million. This growth was primarily fueled by accelerated advancements in AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. The focus on AI innovation and infrastructure enhancements has positioned Google Cloud as a significant contributor to Alphabet's overall revenue growth.

2. **Google Services**: 
   - Google Services revenue grew significantly, from $67,986 million to $76,510 million, marking a 13% increase. This growth was driven by several factors:
     - **Google Search**: Continued to be a major revenue generator, benefiting from increased user engagement and advertising demand.
     - **YouTube Ads**: Contributed to the revenue increase, reflecting strong performance in video advertising.
     - **Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices**: Growth in consumer subscription-based products like YouTube TV and Music, as well as sales from platforms and devices, added to the revenue surge.

3. **Operating Income and Margin**:
   - The increase in revenues from both Google Cloud and Google Services translated into higher operating income. Google Services' operating income increased from $23,937 million to $30,856 million, while Google Cloud's operating income rose from $266 million to $1,947 million. This improvement in operating income, along with efficiency enhancements, led to an expanded operating margin, further contributing to Alphabet's growth.

4. **Constant Currency Revenues**:
   - The growth in constant currency revenues across various geographic regions also played a role. Total constant currency revenues increased by $12.6 billion compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting a 16% growth. This metric helps in assessing true revenue growth by excluding the effects of foreign exchange rate movements.

Overall, the main driver of growth for Alphabet in Q3 2024 was the robust increase in revenues, particularly from Google Cloud and Google Services, supported by strategic investments in AI and operational efficiencies.

### Contextual Summarization vs Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- **Contextual Summarization**: The key advantage of contextual summarization is that it extracts information in direct relation to the user's query. This ensures that the generated summaries are directly relevant, reducing the chances of missing crucial information hidden across different chunks. However, summarizing all chunks requires processing more data, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming.

- **Traditional RAG**: In traditional RAG, the document is split into smaller chunks, and only the chunks most relevant to the user's query are retrieved. While this reduces processing costs and allows more efficient handling of large corpora, it can potentially miss important context when the query is ambiguous or when relevance isn't captured well by the retrieval model. RAG is generally faster, but contextual gaps might occur.

Overall, contextual summarization tends to provide more comprehensive and query-specific responses, while traditional RAG offers speed and simplicity.

### Applications of Contextual Summarization

1. **Customer Support**: Summarizing long support tickets or chat histories to quickly get the context relevant to a specific customer query.

2. **Medical Records Analysis**: When a doctor has to make a decision based on a patient's extensive medical history, contextual summarization could highlight the most pertinent medical notes based on a particular health concern.

3. **Legal Documents**: Extracting relevant clauses or details from lengthy contracts based on specific user questions, helping lawyers quickly understand potential issues or opportunities.

4. **Research Papers**: Summarizing relevant information from multiple research papers for scientists working on a specific hypothesis, reducing the time spent reading unrelated content.

5. **Financial Reports**: Extracting key insights related to performance, trends, or growth across quarterly or annual reports, particularly when comparing current performance to prior periods.
